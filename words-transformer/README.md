Words Transformer
====================

[![CI](https://github.com/magiclen/words-transformer-rs/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/magiclen/words-transformer-rs/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is a simple tool that you can easily establish your dictionary to pair words together. You may use this application to translate texts from one language into another language and to make sure that your words in your context are consistent.

## TODO

1. Wait `iced` for supporting dialogs or multiple windows.
